            <p id="aboutblurb">A. Read is an artist based in NYC. She was first inspired by her fourth grade art teacher, and then went on to study painting, print making and art history at Smith College. Later, long stints at Christie’s Auction House and a major New York Gallery provided hands-on interaction with Post-War and Contemporary  painting and sculpture. References to Abstract Expressionist, Color Field, and Conceptual art can be found in A. Read’s work. She currently lives happily with her family and yellow Lab in the country.</p>
